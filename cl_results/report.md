## Recommendations

### Use Case Recommendations

1. **For Production Deployment (Best Balance)**:
   - Use **Hybrid LoRA** for best accuracy-efficiency-memory trade-off
   - Provides strong performance with parameter-efficient updates

2. **For Resource-Constrained Environments**:
   - Use **Frozen Backbone** for fastest training and minimal memory
   - Only trains classification head, very efficient

3. **For Maximum Accuracy**:
   - Use **Naive** strategy
   - Accept higher computational cost for 12.83% accuracy

4. **For Minimal Forgetting**:
   - Use **Frozen Backbone** strategy
   - Best for scenarios where retaining old knowledge is critical

### Hyperparameter Tuning Suggestions

- **Memory Buffer**: Current size is 100, consider increasing for better replay coverage
- **Learning Rate**: Current LR is 0.001, may benefit from learning rate scheduling
- **LoRA Rank**: Current rank is 8, try r=16 for more capacity or r=4 for efficiency

## Conclusion

This experiment demonstrates the effectiveness of various continual learning strategies on the SplitCIFAR-100 benchmark. The results show that:

- **Hybrid approaches** (combining multiple techniques) generally outperform single-method strategies
- **Parameter-efficient methods** (LoRA) can achieve competitive performance with dramatically fewer trainable parameters
- **Memory-based methods** (replay) provide consistent performance across tasks
- **Regularization methods** (EWC) help but may not be sufficient alone

For most practical applications, we recommend starting with the Hybrid LoRA strategy and tuning hyperparameters based on your specific requirements for accuracy, speed, and memory constraints.
